    * The main trend which helped propel the ecommerce industry was consumer trust. As more people became more willing to buy thing online from Amazon and Ebay exisitng businesses started to work on their online presence and new businesses found opportunity to get their businesses of the ground with very litlle overhead. People becoming tethered to their smart phones and companies such as google and apple making online payment easy and secure further increased online shopping. the rise of Social media and integration with apps allowing content creators to market products. to meet these needs ecommerce solutions providers helped make platforms to integrate with social media, helped business owners ship their products to consumers fasters and allowed them to setup easy and secure payment methods.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
    * Shopify currently host over one million retailers worldside on it's platform. which accounbts for $319 billion in economic activity.
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
    * Shopify has two main sources of income subscriptions and merchant services. For there subscription service common metrics would be monthly recurring revenue and it's many forms:
        * New MRR - gains from new subscribers
        * Expansion MRR - gains from upgrades in subscription level (Basic, main, advanced for shopify)
        * Reactivation MRR
        * Contraction MRR - losses from downgrades in subscriptions
    * since Shopify also offers a free trial they would want to track trial conversion rate which is just the amount of free trials that start a paid subscription over all free trial subscribers
    * as far as merchant solution the metrics used would be more traditional sale metrics such as:
        * sales growth = (Current sales revenue - Past Sales Revenue)/Past Sales Revenue
        * Profit Margin = ((Sales - Total Expenses) ÷ Revenue)
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
    * Shopify has been doing very well ever since inception. It is currently ranked Canada's top company. Shopify holds close to 20% of the market share coming in second to WooCommerce
## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
    * The suggestion that I would make is to imporve there shipping abilities by offering drone shipping and to combat any limitiations of distance use blockchain technology (This is currentl being patented by walmart)
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
    * as more people are demanding same day or next day delivery the speed of shipping needs to improve and traditional methods will soon no longer cut it. Shipping cost is also something people no longer want to pay for. Drones eleimnate musch of the labor intensive and fuel cost involved and can start shipping a package instantly unlike an airplane or truck. 
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
    * Blockchain technology would be needed in addtion to the drones
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
    * Since drones can't cover long distances a network of drones will be needed. To ensure each drone knows which dron is part of it's fleet and that the right package is being delivered to the correct place. All this authentication needs to be secured and can be done using blockchain keys
